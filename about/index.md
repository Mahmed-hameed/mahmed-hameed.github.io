I'm an IT and cyber security student in Sydney. I focus on practical builds, clean documentation, and proving impact with metrics.

**Strengths**
- Python scripting, Flask apps, basic Docker
- Networking fundamentals, Wireshark, Linux
- Security tooling: Burp Suite, Autopsy/FTK, Nmap

**Goals**
- Land an internship/part-time role where I can ship small tools, automate tasks, and contribute to security hygiene.
